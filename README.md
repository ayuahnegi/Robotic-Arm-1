# Robotic-Arm
## Description:
    • Articulated Robotic Arm
    • 5 Degree of Freedom
    • Controlled with 6 Channel RC Transmitter
  ## Components:
    • Arduino Nano
    • MG996R Servos
    • MG90s Servos
    • RC transmitter and Receiver
    • 3D printed body
    • SMPS 12V
    • 7805 ICs
  ## Working:
    6 servos are controlled with 6 Channels of RC transmitter which is
    Received by its Receiver which whose signal is processed by Arduino
    Nano which controls the movement of all the servos.
    12V supply is converted into 5v with the help of 7805 IC voltage
    regulators.
  ## Applications:
    • Welding Robot
    • Material Handling Robot
    • Palletizing Robot
    • Painting robot
    • Assembly Robot
  ## Future Development:
    • Completely Autonomous
    • Works on Inverse Kinematics
    • Different End-Effectors for Different purpose (e.g.- 3D Printing, Drawing, etc.)
